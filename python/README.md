# Neural Network 

This folder contains the python simple implementation of a neural network in python, inspired from the Sequential implementation model followed in Keras. 

# Usage

Stack the neural network layers in a list obejct and pass it through the neural network. The current state of the assigment submission doesn't contain implementation of a fit and predict methods, which are implemented as n.feedForward(), n.backProp() and n.update_weights() of the fit method and the dot product of all the weight vectors with the test data.
